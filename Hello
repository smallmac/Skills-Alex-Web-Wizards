Hello Alex Web Wizards!

Welcome to Github. This is the platform that we are going to use to build your web skills.

I am also new to the whole github thing. But we shall work our way around it together. For now, the point is that we can share files and see them reflected in the frequentseasbegin domain when we upload them.

Explore Github by yourselves to better understand it. I shall do the same and we can learn together.

<!-- NB NB NB NB -->

DO  NOT SHARE ANY PASSWORDS OR LOG IN DETAILS OVER GITHUB. IT IS A PUBLIC SITE WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING!

Let's have fun and learn some code!!!
